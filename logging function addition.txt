## Logging Features Added:

### 1. **Dual Logging System**
- **General Server Log**: Records all server operations, errors, and debug information
- **User Activity Log**: Specifically tracks user actions (joins, leaves, messages)

### 2. **Log Levels**
- **DEBUG**: Detailed technical information for troubleshooting
- **INFO**: General operational information
- **WARNING**: Issues that don't break functionality but should be noted
- **ERROR**: Errors that affect functionality
- **CRITICAL**: Severe errors that might cause the server to fail

### 3. **File Organization**
- Logs are saved to a `logs/` directory (created automatically)
- Daily log rotation with timestamps in filenames
- Separate files for general server logs and user activity logs

### 4. **What Gets Logged**

**User Activities:**
- User connections/disconnections with session duration
- Username selection attempts
- Chat room joins/leaves with duration and message counts
- Menu option selections
- Private room access

**Server Operations:**
- Server startup/shutdown
- Connection attempts and failures
- Message broadcasting success/failure rates
- Chat room creation and member counts
- Error handling and recovery

**Technical Details:**
- Network connection issues
- Data transmission errors
- Process management for text adventures
- Resource cleanup operations

### 5. **Console + File Output**
- Important information is displayed on console
- All details are saved to log files
- Different formatting for console vs file logs

## Usage:

The logging system starts automatically when you run the server. Log files will be created in the `logs/` directory with names like:
- `server_20241215.log` - General server operations
- `user_activity_20241215.log` - User-specific activities

The logging provides valuable insights for:
- **Debugging**: Track down issues with detailed error logs
- **Monitoring**: See server performance and user engagement
- **Analytics**: Understand user behavior patterns
- **Security**: Monitor connection attempts and user activities

The system is production-ready and handles log rotation, error recovery, and resource management automatically!
